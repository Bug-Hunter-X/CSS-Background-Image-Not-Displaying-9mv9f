This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle CSS bug related to background image display. The bug.css file contains the erroneous code, while the solution.css file provides the corrected version. The primary cause of this bug stems from an incorrect or missing path to the background image. This often arises from incorrect relative path calculations or forgetting to include the image in the project's directory structure. Ensure that the image file is present and its path is correctly specified within the CSS file. For optimal results, always use relative paths relative to the CSS file for more maintainable code.
