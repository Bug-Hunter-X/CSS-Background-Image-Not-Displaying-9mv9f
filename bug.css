The following CSS code snippet exhibits an unusual error where the background image does not appear as expected, despite the seemingly correct implementation:

```css
.container {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}
```

The issue occurs due to an incorrect or missing path to the image. The path must be relative to the CSS file or absolute.
